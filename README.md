# News-Around-the-Globe

News-Around-the-Globe is a simple news app 🗞️ which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top news headlines from the API. The main aim of this app is to implement & show how Recycler View works in android.


The idea is to keep the app super simple while demonstrating new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality Android applications.
